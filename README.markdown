# terite's dotfiles

thanks, @holman

**Watch out!**, I'm opinionated and messy.
You should probably look at
[holman's original repo](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) instead of this one.

[holman wrote a blog post](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/) on the subject.

## Usage
### install
```sh
git clone https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake
```

### fix symlinks after additions/deletions
```sh
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake redo
```
